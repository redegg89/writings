After Thor yelling at NoobMaster69 for the 3rd time this week, he decided he should probably get off.

Of course, just because he should doesn't mean he did.

He continued playing and, like thor said, he flew over to NoobMaster69's house. He then proceeded to pull off NoobMaster69's arms and shove them up his ass. 

Little did he know that Thor was just getting started.

Thor then quickly removed NoobMaster's arms very quickly, for maximum pain and left him to die there.
