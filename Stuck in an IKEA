It started as any ordinary day, I was just browsing Reddit. I saw a meme about how easy it is to get lost in IKEA. Normally, I would just upvote and move on, but for some reason, I thought, "IKEAS aren't that hard to move around, right?"

I couldn't be more wrong.

When I got there, I saw a nice desk and since I needed a new one anyway, I decided to buy it. 

At this point, my chair was getting pretty old as well, as it's the same one I had at my job 15 years ago. After looking around for a while, I finally gave up and asked where the chairs were.

"Go straight and on your left you'll see a sign for tables. Go down that aisle and go right."

I thanked him and off I went. The table aisle wasn't hard to find, but the chairs...

Oh the chairs.

I just kept walking and walking, but I eventually found them. I picked one out and decided to go home before I got distracted by something else.

There was just one problem...

I couldn't find checkout, the doors, or anybody who could point me in the right direction. Right then is when I realized why everybody talks about getting stuck in an IKEA.

I searched for hours and hours, but I couldn't find anyone. I finally found the beds and decided to go to sleep, hoping someone would find me.

Days, weeks, and maybe even months went by, but I still couldn't find my way out. I decided to try the meatballs and while they aren't terrible, they're nothing to write home about.

I've been stuck in here for a while now and I have to say, it's actually pretty nice, but I want to see my family and friends.
