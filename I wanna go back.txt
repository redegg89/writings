It's 2050. As I'm going to work, I glance over at my DS. I decide to bring it with me to play on, since I haven't played it in years, possibly decades, and I have nothing better to do on the train. A kid, probably no older than 15, asks, "What's that?"

What's that.

Those words echo in my head for about a second before I feel a tear roll down my cheek.

"Nobody remembers the DS," I think. "I realy have aged quite a bit since 2011 when I got this as a gift, haven't I?" 

I look back over at the child and all I can do is show him what a DS is and hope he becomes interested in what is now "retro gaming."

The kid says to me, "This was really fun, I hope I see you around."

When I get home from work, I decide to play some Trials HD on my 360 to try to go back to that time, when I was 11 and had no cares in the world. I turn off all ways I have of telling the time, even changing the date on the 360 itself. Despite all this, I can't do it. I want to go back so bad, but I just can't, not without the friends I made during that time and they haven't been on in years. I send them a message, "Wanna play some Halo?" I don't know why I sent that message, messages were changed so dramatically on Xbox that you can only send messages on the latest consoles. I can't go back, no matter how hard I try.
