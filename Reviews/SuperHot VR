This is a great game. The graphics, while not AAA level, have their own charm to them, the sound is great and matches the graphics quite well in my opinion, and who doesn't want to shoot red guys? Now you might be wondering why I don't recommend this game, even though I'm talking so highly of it.

The game used to have scenes which were "disturbing" (I didn't have a problem with them myself, but you never know). The developers added a toggle, which was fine. Then they just outright removed them. If a company's gonna remove something that, I'd say, contributed to the story, I can't recommend the game in its current state. For legal reasons, I cannot condone piracy, but, considering they are removing perfectly fine features that could be turned off by a toggle, I can't condemn it either.
