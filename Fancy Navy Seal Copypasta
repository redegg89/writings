Excuse me good sir, but what exactly did you say to me? Before you answer, you should probably know that I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals and have been involved in numerous secret raids on the terrorist group known as Al-Quaeda, and during that time I have taken over 300 men's lives. I have been trained in a military tactic known as "gorilla warfare" and I'm the top sniper in the US Armed Forces. To me, you are nothing but another target. If I have to, I will wipe you out with precision never before seen on this Earth. If you think you could get away with saying something that vulgar to me over the internet, you are clearly mistaken. As we are conversing, I am contacting my secret network of spies that span the entirety of the United States of America and your IP is being traced as well, so if I were you, I'd prepare for the storm. This storm could easily wipe out your life. I can be anywhere, at any time, and kill you in over 700 different ways with my bare hands alone. Not only that, but I am able to access the entire arsenal of the Marine Corps and will make use of it to its full extent. If you knew what havoc would ensue from your comment, you probably would've kept your mouth shut, but you didn't and now you're paying the price. There is no chance you'll survive.
